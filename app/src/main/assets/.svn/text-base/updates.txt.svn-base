Version 1.1
- Removed "test data" button.
- Added in blue screen filter by mall.
- Added screen for product price history (invoked by long clicking over a product).
- Added screen to send feedback. Please use it!
- Welcome screen with changes in new version (the screen you're watching).

Version Inicial
Welcome to Shop List Simple!

I tried to make this app small & simple, with very few components: 
- Yellow screen to see current shopping list.
- Blue screen to manage the whole product list.

Some more things will be added in next versions, but I'll try to keep it simple.
Your first step now should be clicking on 'Edit shoppling list' button to go to blue screen, and start adding things to buy.
